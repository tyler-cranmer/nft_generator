# NFT Image Generator

This is a jupyter notebook that was created to programatically generate any number of NFT pictures for my Meme NFT Collection. The code could be reconfigured to be used in other projects as well. 

## Installation
If you dont already have pip installed, download package manager [pip] (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) before installing any of the dependencies.

Install JupyterLab with pip:
```shell
pip install jupyterlab
```

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:
```shell
jupyter-lab
```

Install Pillow
```shell
pip install pillow
```

Install iPython
```shell
 pip install ipython
 ```

## Usage

In order for the code to work, you must generate an image, layers and metadata folder.

```shell
mkdir images && mkdir layer && mkdir metadata
```

## Disclaimer

If anyone is interested in using this as a framework, you will need to configure the code to match your collection parameters. Currently, this notebook is configured to for my project and the layering files have been removed.
